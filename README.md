# Rory Hodgson

I'm Rory - a recent graduate of Makers Academy. I left behind academia for the "real word" of Digital Marketing, with budgets and projections and data-led analysis. But I found it was still too soft and opinion-led, and I wanted to deal with hard problems, not just meetings and emails.

So I left behind what was actually a good career by gambling on a coding bootcamp. I was scared I might find I was the worst person in the class, but I actually found myself keeping and really enjoying what I was doing. I found myself lost for hours in trying to solve a problem, rather than watching the clock.

In my previous life I was responsible for a slew of successful campaigns, with increasingly large budgets (handling multi-million pound budgets on for some product launches), and working on an international scope. I'm proud of the contributions I made, both in terms of large, successful campaigns, as well as lasting changes (e.g. building complex spreadsheets that automate daily/weekly/monthly tasks).

I learned a lot from my previous career, about team work, budgets, planning and client management, which I carry forward today, and which I think sets me apart from some of the younger guys in this field who have the same know-how, but can be a bit more of a liability given their lack of real world experience.

## Projects

Please check out my pinned respositories for projects I'm most proud of. These include:

https://github.com/rorybot/Team-Agotchi
Purpose: Build A Tamagotchi clone, for the final two week group project at Makers Academy, in a language and platform I hadn't used (Swift, for an iOS app)

What I learned: So many of the basic principles are the same, and yet when you go from RESTful apps to something like a Game, you have to adapt to the new architecture and requirements of the platform you're using, since the "Model-View-Controller" style didn't quite map

https://github.com/rorybot/Single-Page-Notes-App 
Purpose: Build a basic Notes app using pure javascript (no libraries except very basic HTTP library from Node; jQuery explicitly prohibited) that can handle storage and presentation of data.

What I learned: Why libraries are so useful, but how they can be a shortcut that hold you back from learning proper architecture. Also, while I like the neat rendering method we came up with, it was an example of over-complicating things somewhat.

https://github.com/rorybot/chitter-challenge
Purpose: Build a simple Twitter clone. Basic RESTful server that takes Post requests when submitting a post, and Gets them for presentation. Also attributes them to users, who can only post when logged in (handles registration and login).

Tech used: Sinatara/Ruby, HTML, on a basic MVC structure.


https://github.com/rorybot/GildedRose - 
Purpose: Solve the Gilded Rose refactoring challenge. A nice example of OOD work. 
My approach: My approach was to convert it from the nested if-else statement that it was, to a set of objects injected into the Item class. These objects are then analysed by the main Gilded Rose class and used to decide which modifier to apply.

What I learned: I failed to write tests prior to refactoring, and doing it test-led would've saved me a lot of headaches where I had to mentally figure out if the code still worked, and would've given me direct feedback instaed.

https://github.com/rorybot/tic-tac-toe - 
Purpose: Create the underlying architecture for a simple tic-tac-toe game that could be plugged into any interface. The goal was to practice good OOD and to make it something that could be easily plugged into any sort of interface (which meant keeping a clear track of the logic, of the public/private separation, and keeping clear what the input/outputs should be).

What I learned: There can sometimes be endless ways to skin a cat. I spent a lot of time moving code between classes, in a way that didn't necessarily make things clearer, instead of focusing on other methods of simplifaction.

## Skills

#### Project Management

Multiple product launches while working as Global Paid Search and Social AM at Maxus

- A team was assembled to handle some new business (a Tech company, with Consumer and Corporate faces). I was originally hired as a contractor to deal with the new client, and then moved to a permanent position to help grow the client.
- Annual billings growing 300% over the first year with the client, and a further 130% in the final quarter I was working there
- Coverage grew from 4 local markets and some global scope, to regular global activites, with local executions across WEU and EMEA (I had to work closely with Heads of Department in each market to execute plans)
- Client satisfaction grew from ~50% at our first performance review to ~90% a year later; a Valentine's Day project I oversaw independent of the rest of the team won a "Mini Magnet" within the company.
- Growth of billings and scope of work was about working well as a team under a lot of pressure, under difficult circumstances (dealing with a client HQ'd in China, with Hubs in multiple timezones), as well as each individual like myself being committed 100% to multiple projects at the same time, weaving a careful balance between everything going on and learning how to keep a very difficult client, with a very different culture, happy.

#### Client Management

Closely related to the above, except I'd say managing the project was more about how I managed and structured time and resources, as well as leveraging other skills to get things done. The other important aspect has been the client work.

- When working at Maxus, I had multiple stakeholders on any project, around the globe, and I was often acting as a mediator between parts of the business that didn't communicate very well, as well as with all the various suppliers and other agencies involved.
- When working at Rocket, I often worked with less complex clients, but with a mixture of Retail and Entertainment clients it presented different challenges, as the Retail clients required a lot of frequent and very detailed updates (presented in a digestible way), while the Entertainment clients were prone to last-minute changes and to doing things against our processes.
- In both cases, I was entrusted with unmediated client contact, and had to learn how to communicate good news in a way that wasn't riddled with technical jargon, and how to communicate bad news (missed targets or errors in execution) in a way that didn't harm the client's perception of the agency.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (August 2017 to Dec 2017)

- 12 Weeks of study
- Started off being capable of passing some rudimentary katas; came out being able to build clean, well-tested, well-structured, extensible, hosted web apps that communicate with a database (in both pure Ruby + HTML, and then again in Rails, and then again in Javascript, and rounded off in a group project, teaching ourselves to build an app in Swift, employing all the best practices we learned along the way)
- Learnt how to practice good OOD in a TDD way
- Practiced Agile/XP
- Learnt Ruby, Rails, Javascript and Swift
- Extensive testing with RSpec, Jasmine and XCode test suite


#### University (Oct 2008 to Jun 2011)
Philosophy BA, University of York
- Focus on Naturalistic Ethics (Aristotle, Foot and Rand)
- Achieved a 2:1
- Involved in Philosophy Soc and DramaSoc
- Went out to America annually for Objectivist Philosophy Conferences
