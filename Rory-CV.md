# Rory Hodgson

I'm Rory - a recent graduate of Makers Academy, where I've become a pretty decent Junior Developer.

Originally studying Philosophy at Uni, intent on becoming an academic, I attended a number of conferences, but realised profesional academia wasn't for me. I kept it as just a hobby once I graduated, but instead went to work in Digital Marketing, because I was enamoured with how precise and data-driven it was. I did planning and buying on Google/Facebook/Twitter/etc, and did that agency-side before going freelance.

I was responsible for a slew of successful campaigns, with increasingly large budgets (handling multi-million pound budgets on for some product launches), and working on an international scope. I'm proud of the contributions I made, both in terms of large, successful campaigns, as well as lasting changes (e.g. building complex spreadsheets that automate daily/weekly/monthly tasks), but the work got fairly repetitive and wasn't all that difficult towards the end. 

I wanted to do programming for a while now, since I always sat near the guys handling the actual coding side of things, and was jealous of how much more interesting their work was. Now I'm up-to-speed as a Junior Developer and... now I'm ready for the *real* learning to begin!

## Projects

Please check out my pinned respositories for projects I'm most proud of. These include:

https://github.com/rorybot/Team-Agotchi - A Tamagotchi clone built in my final two weeks at Makers Academy, as part of a group project. I'm really proud of how much we built with a language we were all learning for the first time. The link there is to a fork I've been working on post-course, trying to clean up the code.

https://github.com/rorybot/Single-Page-Notes-App - A very basic Notes app. Data is lost on refresh, and it simply takes in text and stores it to a link on the page. However, it is written in vanilla javascript, and renders on the page without refresh (AngularJS-style).

https://github.com/rorybot/chitter-challenge - A simple Twitter clone, hosted on Heroku. Users can sign-up, leave a message, sign out again. You can only leave a message if signed in. Basic sinatra webapp. Nice MVC pattern and simple structure.

https://github.com/rorybot/GildedRose - An approach to the Gilded Rose, and a nice example of OOD work. My approach was to convert it from the nested if-else statement that it was, to a set of objects injected into the Item class. These objects are then analysed by the main Gilded Rose class and used to decide which modifier to apply. 

https://github.com/rorybot/tic-tac-toe - A simple tic-tac-toe game, but the goal was to practice good OOD and to make it something that could be easily plugged into any sort of interface (which meant keeping a clear track of the logic, of the public/private separation, and keeping clear what the input/outputs should be).

## Skills

#### Project Management

Multiple product launches while working as Global Paid Search and Social AM at Maxus

- A team was assembled to handle some new business (a Tech company, with Consumer and Corporate faces). I was originally hired as a contractor to deal with the new client, and then moved to a permanent position to help grow the client.
- Annual billings growing 300% over the first year with the client, and a further 130% in the final quarter I was working there
- Coverage grew from 4 local markets and some global scope, to regular global activites, with local executions across WEU and EMEA (I had to work closely with Heads of Department in each market to execute plans)
- Client satisfaction grew from ~50% at our first performance review to ~90% a year later; a Valentine's Day project I oversaw independent of the rest of the team won a "Mini Magnet" within the company.
- Growth of billings and scope of work was about working well as a team under a lot of pressure, under difficult circumstances (dealing with a client HQ'd in China, with Hubs in multiple timezones), as well as each individual like myself being committed 100% to multiple projects at the same time, weaving a careful balance between everything going on and learning how to keep a very difficult client, with a very different culture, happy.

#### Client Management

Closely related to the above, except I'd say managing the project was more about how I managed and structured time and resources, as well as leveraging other skills to get things done. The other important aspect has been the client work.

- When working at Maxus, I had multiple stakeholders on any project, around the globe, and I was often acting as a mediator between parts of the business that didn't communicate very well, as well as with all the various suppliers and other agencies involved.
- When working at Rocket, I often worked with less complex clients, but with a mixture of Retail and Entertainment clients it presented different challenges, as the Retail clients required a lot of frequent and very detailed updates (presented in a digestible way), while the Entertainment clients were prone to last-minute changes and to doing things against our processes.
- In both cases, I was entrusted with unmediated client contact, and had to learn how to communicate good news in a way that wasn't riddled with technical jargon, and how to communicate bad news (missed targets or errors in execution) in a way that didn't harm the client's perception of the agency.
